# Operations
Once software has been deployed the software has to be operated, maintained and debugged. This section provides an incomplete list of tools
that are useful for debugging and otherwise maintaining deployed applicatbions in OCI. The tools are classified into two broad
categories:
 * [Command line tools](./4_1_command_line_tools)
 * [Tools provided by OCI](./4_2_platform_tools)

The coverage of these tools is limited; the goal is to give an overview of some tools and how they can be helfpul but not to
be definitive in coverage.
