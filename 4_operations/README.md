# Operations
Once software has been deployed the software has to be operated and maintained. This section provides an incomplete list of tools
that are useful for debugging and otherwise maintaining deployed applicatbions in OCI. The tools are classified into two broad
categories: command line tools and tools provided by OCI.

The coverage of these tools is very limited.

## Command line tools
### The `oci` CLI

### `sqlcl`

### `terraform`

## Platform tools
### The notification service
