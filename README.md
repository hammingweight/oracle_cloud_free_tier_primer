# Spring Boot on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
This repository contains a "Hello, World" REST Service that can be deployed to OCI. The deployed service uses only free-tier resources.

Hopefully, you'll be able to replace the toy web service with your real one and get it running in OCI.

## Prerequisites
You'll need:
 * An [OCI account](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/)
 * The [OCI CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliinstall.htm)
 * [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.htm)
 
 You'll also need Python 3 (it's included by default in many recent Linux distros.)
